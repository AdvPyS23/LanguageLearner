# Language Learning Assistant 
    Welcome! Croeso! Bienvenido!
To the README file for the Language Learning Assistant App, a one-stop shop for learning vocabulary in foreign languages. In this file you will find details on how to get the program up and running and some information on how to deal with commonly encountered issues. 

## 1. Description

This project aims to make language learning easy and enjoyable by giving users a one-stop-shop for all their vocabulary learning needs. This project will allow users to store their learned vocabulary in multiple languages, to quiz themselves on this vocabulary, and provide visualisations of their progress in different areas to aid in improving on weaker areas. We aim to make this project as versatile and easy to use as possible, supporting a range of different input styles. 

The project is aimed at language learners of all levels, from diverse backgrounds to help them improve their vocabulary at a pace that suits them. 


## 2. Getting Started

* At first, the user will be asked to add word objects with details on their language of origin, meaning, and general grammatical categories. These word objects can then be linked by the user to translations in other languages. THis linked data approach will facilitate the user to test there knowledge in a variety of languages at once!

* Adding more as the project expands.
